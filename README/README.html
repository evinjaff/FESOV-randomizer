Right now, this is just purely a web-based tool to generate random classsets for runs, and is NOT an application that modifies 3DS saves or patches 3DS games (although I may spend some time developing this depending on reception). If you want to do a randomized run of Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia, you will also need 3DS-side tools to modify the game. I suggest Luma3DS or a similar CFW with NTR&#39;s most recent cheat database (should come stock with Luma with no install needed). With this on your system, you should be able to pull up the cheat menu in-game, and be able to use NTR&#39;s All class selectable by class change to hack the Mila altars to allow for the custom classes. Links will be provided below, and in addition, I am leaving a copy of the cheat that makes this possible.</span></p><p><a href='https://3ds.hacks.guide/'><span>3DS Hacks/CFW Guide</span></a></p><p><a href='https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases'><span>Luma3DS</span></a></p><blockquote><p><span>[All class selectable by class change]</span>

You have randomize-as-you go, where whenever you gain a new character/need to promote a character you randomize on the spot; or you can pre-randomize the entire game beforehand by using the Randomize Party feature. Examples of how both work are detailed below. I have also detailed a summary of what each option means after that.</span></p><h3><a name="randomize-as-you-go-example" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Randomize-as-You-Go-Example</span></h3><p><span>You just recruited Silque in Act 1. You select Silque from the drop-down menu for characters, and then check the class tier (Silque starts as a tier 1 class, so you&#39;ll choose tier 1), then choose the conditions you want such as allowing Amiibo classes or Enemy Classes and then hit randomize. After you get Silque&#39;s class, (let&#39;s say she got Pegasus Knight) you load in the cheat code, and visit a Mila alter to IMMEDIATELY change Silque&#39;s class into its randomized option (in this case a Pegasus Knight).</span></p><h3><a name="pre-randomized-example" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Pre-Randomized Example</span></h3><p><span>Before the game starts, you visit the to randomize a class matrix for the entire game. After setting Amiibo/Enemy class conditions, you press Randomize Both to randomize Alm&#39;s Route and Celica&#39;s, and you save a copy of the exported class list. So now, whenever you recruit a new unit, such as Silque in the previous example, you cross-reference your character sheet to determine what class to change her into.</span></p><p><span>Visit </span><a href='https://evinjaff.github.io/FESOV-randomizer'><span>the website</span></a><span> to try it out.</span></p><h2><a name="what-do-the-randomization-rulesclasses-mean" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>What do the randomization rules/classes mean?</span></h2><p><span>Here is a breakdown of all the randomization rules (In Progress):</span></p><ul><li><span>Include Classes?</span></li><li><span>Amiibo Classes?</span></li><li><span>Enemy Classes?</span></li><li><span>Broken/Ugly Classes?</span></li><li><span>Alm and Celica Classes?</span></li><li><span>Generate Overclass?</span></li></ul><h3><a name="allow-amiibo-classes" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Allow Amiibo Classes?</span></h3><p><span>This allows all Amiibo-exclusive classes to be options. Amiibo-exclusive classes were the classes of the illusory fighters that can be summoned via scanning Amiibos such as Lucina, Roy, and Robin. These classes are untiered and possilbe randomizations at every level if enabled. This is by far the coolest option, since the characters models classed into these look a lot like how the Lodestar, Great Lord, Ranger, and Tactitian classes were in </span><em><span>Fates</span></em><span>! So, this means that you could be classed as Lucina, or Marth if you so pleased. In total, this allows these classes to be used:</span></p><figure><table><thead><tr><th><span>Tier</span></th><th><span>Classes</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>Untiered</span></td><td><span>Lord (Marth), Lord (F.

It was a tough choice, but I decided to only include the Enemy Classes that look reasonably like someone was that class for this. This basically means do the heads fit on well, and with the exception of a little bit of clipping, does it feel like you character could truly be that class? If you want every single Enemy class available for class change, check this box and the Ugly Classes? option. Checking just Enemy Classes? allows these possible classes:</span></p><figure><table><thead><tr><th><span>Tier</span></th><th><span>Classes</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>1</span></td><td><span>Arcanist, Brigand, Mogall</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>2</span></td><td><span>Mogall, Brigand</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>3</span></td><td><span>Balor, Dagon, Fire Dragon, Fiend, Guardian</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Untiered</span></td><td><span>Cantor, Arcanist, Witch</span></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="allow-ugly-classes" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Allow Ugly Classes?</span></h3><p><span>This allows all possible classes (Mainly Enemy Classes) that are normally balanced, but do not have a good way to position the head of a character onto it (such as Deimos), so the game feels much more hacked and thereby breaks immersion.</span></p><p><em><span>Note about Revenant/Entombed Classes: Both of these classes have mirrored versions of their normal classes in which you have access to numbing or posion claws. Due to the possible power that this gives you in the early game, I have opted to consider the Venin/Numbing Claw variants promoted versions of the original due to how busted the poisioned condition is.</span></em></p><figure><table><thead><tr><th><span>Tier</span></th><th><span>Classes</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>1</span></td><td><span>Gargoyle, Entombed (Normal), Revenant (Normal), Bonewalker</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>2</span></td><td><span>Entombed (Numbing), Entombed (Venin), Revenant (Numbing),  Revenant (Numbing), Titan, Lich, Necodragon, Fafnir, Bonewalker</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>3</span></td><td><span>Deathgoyle, Lich, Garuda, Deimos, Vestal, Mila Apostole, White Dragon, Duma Apostole</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Untiered</span></td><td><span>None</span></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3><a name="allow-broken-classes" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Allow Broken Classes?</span></h3><p><span>Checking this will allow for you to have classes that are just plain broken.

(ex. if you don&#39;t have DLC installed and a character like Alm is a Conqueror). In this class, your character retains its stats, but its movement is reduced to 1 and the unit cannot attack. The character&#39;s class is reverted back to its intended class if either the system is able to load the correct class data via reboting/inserting an SD card with the class data, opening a file on a console that has the class data installed. This class is mostly designed as an anti-DLC-sharing mechanic that Echoes implemented that&#39;s much harsher than Awakening. In Awakening, all that happened if you couldn&#39;t load the DLC Dread Fighter and Bride Classes was that they became a generic tactitian and lost their class skills but still retained their ability to attack and could fight.</span></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2><a name="technical-notes-on-randomization" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Technical Notes on Randomization</span></h2><h3><a name="dungeon-softlocking" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Dungeon Softlocking</span></h3><p><span>Throught some testing, I have determined that Alm can only be reclassed into a Fighter, Hero, Conqueror, or Unknown and still retain the ability to attack in dungeons. This means that for certain dungerons, you can potentially softlock yourself inside a dungeon since Alm will not be able to break boxes blocking the path to the boss. The most prominent exmaple of this is the Fear Mountain Shrine on Alm&#39;s route, where there is a Mila altar that is blocked by a stone wall and some boxes. If you enter the room and reclass Alm into a class other than his class tree or an Unknown, he will lose the ability to attack when you press A, meaning that once you leave the Mila statue, he will</span></p><p><span> By reclassing Alm to any class other than his class tree, you get softlocked since you can press A to break the boxes and get through.</span></p><h3><a name="spell-lists" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Spell Lists</span></h3><p><span>As most of you know, some characters are naturally oriented towards spellcasting (ex.

Additionally, Fell Gods have a mix of a mage and Sage/Priestess spell list, where they learn both mage and sage spell levels (ex.

They lose the ability when transferring out of the pegausus knight class. However, the game devs chose to decide triangle attack ability based on if the character was a flyer, since pegasus knights were the only playable character class in the game (RIP Wyvern Riders.) So as a result, they gain compatibility in some outside classes that they weren&#39;t intended to class because of the developers&#39; poor choice. The options are listed below:</span></p><ul><li><span>Pegaus Knight</span></li><li><span>Falcon Knight</span></li><li><span>Harrier</span></li><li><span>Gargoyle</span></li><li><span>Deathgoyle</span></li><li><span>Necodragon</span></li><li><span>White Dragon</span></li><li><span>Mogall</span></li><li><span>Mila&#39;s Servant</span></li><li><span>Duma&#39;s Apostole</span></li><li><span>Garuda</span></li><li><span>Fafnir</span></li><li><span>Balor</span></li></ul><h2><a name="what-are-you-up-toworking-on-right-now" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>What are you up to/working on right now?</span></h2><p><span>I&#39;m working on two main things: One, I&#39;m grabbing game asset data and sifting through the spritesheets to build animated GIFs of sprites that only have publicly available non-animated images. Second, I&#39;m going to focus on tweaks to make the tool more usable, such as allowing an export to PDF/CSV option that is probabaly much easier than just using print to save a PDF.</span></p><h2><a name="current-and-upcoming-extra-features" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Current and Upcoming Extra Features</span></h2><ul><li><strong><span>Basic Randomization of a Character or Party:</span></strong><span> Randomly generates either a random class for an individual character or generates random classes for Alm&#39;s/Celica&#39;s party</span></li><li><strong><span>2-Tier Randomization Options:</span></strong><span> Ability to determine how to randomize 2-tier classes such as the Mage or Pegasus Knight. Gives the option to Randomize it such that (Mage: Tier 1 Sage: Tier 2, Tier 3) if you want it a little easier, and (Mage: Tier 1, Tier 2, Sage: Tier 3) if you want it a little bit harder.</span></li><li><strong><span>Collection of Animated Map Spirte GIFS:</span></strong><span> A near-entire library of animated GIFS of Fire Emblem Echoes map sprites these are suprisingly hard to find. I am still animating sprite GIFS for some of the characters.</span></li><li><strong><span>Specific Character Sprites:</span></strong><span> Loads specific character sprites when possible to show you what you character will look like as that option. If a sprite can&#39;t be found a generic sprite will display instead. This only works on classes that are possibly through either regular gameplay/pitchfork method. This means that edge cases such as Female Barons, non-Alm Heroes, Male Pegasus Knights will still show generic sprites even though they do have an actual in-game sprites that are generated through the game&#39;s head-and-socket system for making map sprites. As time goes on, I am planning on trying to write a program that can mimic the head-and-socket system and generate sprites for all possible options. Hopefully if anyone ever decides to make hacks for FE15 they could use it later.</span></li><li><strong><span>Starting Items (In Progress!):</span></strong><span> Randomizes the starting item that a character will get. Currently writing a scraper and tagger to inventory all the possible game items and set attributes to categorize them (ex. Amiibo weapons, provisions, lances, etc.)</span></li><li><strong><span>Quantum Randomization (In Progress):</span></strong><span> I&#39;m looking at a way to use quantum randomness to randomize the classes instead of just a traditional pseudo-random generation, especially since you can see the flaws of pseudorandomness manifest with a lot of duplicate class assignments. Once I find a solid JS library that doesn&#39;t cost a Kidney to buy a liscense, I will include it.</span></li><li><strong><span>Genericized Randomization (Future):</span></strong><span> In the future, I&#39;m also looking to genericize this tool so that it will eventually be plug&#39;n&#39;play so that you can just import a CSV of characters and a dump of sprites so you could do this for FE8, Awakening, or any other game really.</span></li><li><strong><span>Starting class save editing (Far Future):</span></strong><span> In the far future, am intending on building an add-on for FEST or a save file editor &amp; generator in C++ that pre-randomizes the starting classes via Hex editing. This allows for easy randomization, and could also reduce the time in Ram Village when you&#39;re stuck with characters in their generic classes.</span></li><li><strong><span>Class Tree (This is a pipe dream):</span></strong><span> In the distant future when I get good at writng patches of 3DS games, I am planning on building a patch that randomizes the game similar to the Universal Pokemon Randomizer for Pokemon games or how ROM hacks like Storm Silver patches its roms.</span></li></ul><h2><a name="awesome-id-love-to-do-a-randomized-run-any-suggestions" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Awesome!

If you think there&#39;s something I should change, feel free to submit an issue or email me. I know that there&#39;s a lot of stuff that I haven&#39;t done efficiently since most of my programing experience is with Java, C, and MATLAB. As a result of my limited knowledge, I made my life a lot harder by writing this in almost pure JavaScript with the exception of finally slapping on jQuery at the end for image loading. Also, half of my code is truly spaghetti code, and at some point, I&#39;m going to fix that so someone who is an actual competenet web dev/FE15 fan can understand my code and submit a pull request to fix my horrid code like a knight in shining armor.</span></p></div>
