# Evin's Randomized run Shennanagins Blog



## 6/12/2020

The run begins!! I am going to start my randomized run of Fire Emble Echoes: Shadows of Valentia very soon and I'm super excited. I am going to do all of my class change randomizations via cheat codes, but if that ends up being unfair due to starting stats, I will switch over to save editing. Here is a breakdown of my randomization rules/conditions:

- Alm will keep his normal class progression for dungeon compatibility. Celica will not, and she will be randomized
- Class types included: standard classes, enemy classes, Amiibo classes. Characters with ugly 3D models and broken classes will be excluded.
- Forging is allowed, but I will not be allowed to grind for silver or gold marks via DLC or dungeons, so I will have to choose wisely whether or not forging is worth it.
- DLC will be minimally allowed. The only DLC maps I'm allowing will be the 5 Mila's Bounty levels (Althought the pitchforks will serve no purpose). This will mean that I am allowed to recieve the 5 Gold Marks, Tailisman, Taurus Shard, and Boots. I will also be allowing myself overclasses when I complete Act 5.

Here is my class table for the run:
