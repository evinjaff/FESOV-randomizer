# Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia Randomizer
## What is this for?
This is a randomizer tool for a randomized class run of Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadow of Valentia. Right now, this is just purely a web-based tool to randomize the class of a player; to actually affect the in-game class system, Luma3DS or similar CFW with NTR cheats will be required to be able to hack the Mila Altars to allow for illegal class changes.

## So how do I use this?
Visit [the website](https://evinjaff.github.io/FESOV-randomizer) to try it out. There are two ways to use this. One, you can prerandomize the full run (still in progress). Two, you can randomnize on a "when you get there" model, where you randomize the class for a character when you need to figure out what class they should be when newly promoted/what class they need to be . I will be including a LaTeX docuemnt of how to do that below.

##Current/Upcoming Extra Features

* Ability to determine how to randomize 2-tier classes such as the Mage or Pegauss Knight. Gives the option to Randomize it such that (Mage: Tier 1 Sage: Tier 2, Tier 3) if you want it a little easier, and (Mage: Tier 1, Tier 2, Sage: Tier 3) if you want it a little bit harder.

* Ability to control what external classes are let in. 

* Uses specific character sprites when possible to show you what you character will look like as that option. If a sprite can't be found a generic sprite will display instead. This only works on classes that are possibly through either regular gameplay/pitchfork method. This means that edge cases such as Female Barons, non-Alm Heroes, Male Pegasus Knights will still show generic sprites even though they do have an actual in-game sprite that's automatically generated through the game's head-and-body system for designing sprites. An alternate method inserting the heads instead is to be implemented soon.

* Starting Items (In Progress!) Randomizes the starting items that a character will get.
